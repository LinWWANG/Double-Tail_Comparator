Paper Abstract:
This paper reports a reference-less frequencydetector-less single-loop bang-bang clock and data recovery
(BBCDR) circuit featuring wide frequency acquisition. We use
a current-starved ring oscillator controlled by a 5-bit resistive
digital-to-analog converter to maintain quarter-rate operation,
supporting a capture range of 110.4%. By the virtue of a
deliberate-current-mismatch charge pump pair, we form the
single-sided capture scheme in the frequency detection characteristic, eliminating the power-hungry circuits in the high-speed
clock and data paths. Employing a hybrid control circuit, the
proposed BBCDR automates frequency acquisition and phase
tracking in the overall 32 bands. Prototyped in a 65-nm CMOS,
the BBCDR covers a wide data rate from 10.8 to 37.4 Gb/s,
achieving an acquisition speed of 4.63 [(Gb/s)/Âµs] and an energy
efficiency of 1.3 pJ/bit.
